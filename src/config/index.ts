			intro:
				'🚀 Hi there! I’m Volodymyr - a tech enthusiast at the crossroads of programming and artificial intelligence. Transforming ideas into reality, I’m deep-diving into the world of LLMs (and not only) to shape the future. 🌟',
			bio: [
				'From modding games to mastering AI, my journey is fueled by an insatiable curiosity and a desire to solve real-world problems.',
				'With a solid foundation in backend development using Node.js and a creative foray into game development, I’ve pivoted towards exploring the limitless potential of artificial intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs).',
				'My toolkit includes (and not limited to) technologies like Nest.js, ExpressJS, TypeORM, React, Svelte, and a proficiency in DevOps practices with AWS, Docker, and more, ensuring a versatile approach to building robust solutions.',
				'My recent explorations have led me to install and experiment with cutting - edge models like Llama 2, Mixtral, and the formidable GPT- 4 Turbo.Watching lectures by luminaries such as Sam Altman and Andy Karpathy, I’m continually expanding my understanding and application of AI technologies.',
				'My aim? To fine-tune LLMs to develop innovative tools such as a CI/CD LLM agent for code reviews, harnessing the power of AI to streamline and enhance the development process.',
				'I believe in using AI not just as a technological advancement, but as a means to contribute meaningfully to the world.',
				'By integrating LLMs like GPT-4 into my projects and utilizing tools like GitHub Copilot, I am not just increasing productivity but also paving the way for intelligent brainstorming and decision - making processes.',
				'My portfolio, crafted with the assistance of LLMs, stands as a testament to what’s possible when technology meets creativity.',
				'Let’s connect and explore how we can solve complex challenges, push boundaries, and innovate for a brighter future. 🚀💡'
